<p class="paper-paragraph">
    Autonomous wheeled-legged robots have the potential to transform logistics systems, improving  operational efficiency and adaptability in urban environments.
    Navigating urban environments,however, poses unique challenges for robots, necessitating innovative solutions for locomotion and navigation. 
    These challenges include the need for adaptive locomotion across varied terrains and the ability to navigate efficiently around complex dynamic obstacles. 
    This work introduces a fully integrated system comprising adaptive locomotion control, mobility-aware local navigation planning, and large-scale path planning within the city.
    Using model-free reinforcement learning (RL) techniques and privileged learning, we develop a versatile locomotion controller. 
    This controller achieves efficient and robust locomotion over various rough terrains, facilitated by smooth transitions between walking and driving modes.
    It is tightly integrated with a learned navigation controller through a hierarchical RL framework, enabling effective navigation through challenging terrain and various obstacles at high speed.
    Our controllers are integrated into a largescale urban navigation system and validated by autonomous, kilometer-scale navigation missions conducted in Zurich, Switzerland, and Seville, Spain.
    These missions demonstrate the system’s robustness and adaptability, underscoring the importance of integrated control systems in
    achieving seamless navigation in complex environments. Our findings support the feasibility of
    wheeled-legged robots and hierarchical RL for autonomous navigation, with implications for lastmile delivery and beyond.

       <b>(A)</b> Our city navigation workflow begins with offline preparation, involving scanning the test area using a handheld laser scanner and constructing a navigation graph.
       <b>(B)</b> The robot autonomously navigated the urban environment to reach 13 predetermined goal points, selected in an arbitrary order. 
       <b>(i and ii)</b> Path planning within the city was facilitated by the pre-generated navigation graph.

        The presented controller has been deployed in diverse natural environments.
        These include steep mountain trails, creeks with running water, mud, thick vegetation, loose rubble,
        snow-covered
        hills, and a damp forest.
        A number of specific scenarios are further highlighted in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 1</a>A-F. These environments have
        characteristics that the policy does not experience during training. The terrains can deform and crumble, with
        significant variation of material properties over the surface. The robot's legs are subjected to frequent
        disturbances due to vegetation, rubble, and sticky mud.
        Existing terrain estimation pipelines that use cameras or LiDAR fail in environments
        with
        snow (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 1</a>A), water (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 1</a>C),
        or dense vegetation (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 1</a>F).
        Our controller does not rely on exteroception and is immune to such failure.
        The controller learns omnidirectional locomotion based on a history of proprioceptive observations and
        is robust in zero-shot deployment on terrains with characteristics that were never experienced during training.
    </p>

    <p class="paper-paragraph">
        Our controller was used by the Cerberus team for the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Urban Circuit
        (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 1</a>G).
        It replaced a model-based controller that had been employed used by the team in the past.
        The objective of the competition is to develop robotic systems that rapidly map, navigate,
        and search complex underground environments, including tunnels, urban underground, and cave
        networks. The human operators are not allowed to assist the robots during the competition physically;
        only teleoperation is allowed. Accordingly, the locomotion controller needs to perform without failure
        over extended mission durations.
        The presented controller drove two ANYmal-B robots in four missions of 60 minutes. The
        controller exhibited a zero failure rate throughout the competition. A steep staircase that was traversed
        by one of the robots during the competition is shown in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 1</a>G.

        Next we test robustness to foot slippage.
        To introduce slippage, we used a moistened whiteboard.
        The results are shown in <a href="#movieS5">Movie 3</a>.
        The baseline quickly loses balance, aggressively swings the legs, and falls. In contrast, the presented
        controller adapts to the slippery terrain and successfully locomotes in the commanded direction.
